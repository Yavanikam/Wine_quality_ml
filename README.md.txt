# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis Project

This project explores how different chemical properties in red wine affect its quality rating. I used real-world data to uncover patterns and build insights, focusing on visual storytelling and data interpretation—key skills in data analytics.

---

## 🧠 What I Did (in Simple Terms)

- I studied a dataset of red wine samples, each rated for quality by experts.
- I explored how different ingredients—like acidity, sugar, alcohol—impact the quality rating.
- I used graphs and charts to find meaningful patterns in the data.
- I summarized insights that could help winemakers understand what makes good wine.

## 📊 Key Learnings and Findings

- Wines with higher **alcohol content** generally scored higher in quality.
- Features like **volatile acidity** negatively impacted wine quality.
- I visualized trends using:
  - **Bar charts** for frequency analysis
  - **Heatmaps** to see relationships between variables
  - **Histograms and Box Plots** to understand data distribution and outliers
